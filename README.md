### What i would improve further:
frontend:
- optimistic updates
- flat tree no nesting of objects in the state tree aka normalizr
- tests for reducers + more integration tests
- more mobile adjustments
- redux router
- better CONST handling
- branch by feature
- fix animation

backend:
- dont screw the user and topic relation
- calculate the points in backend + liked / not liked
- more tests for bulletproof ACL
